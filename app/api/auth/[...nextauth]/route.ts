// The handler is exported for use in the Next.js API routes, enabling the authentication flow to be integrated seamlessly into the application.
// The authOptions define the authentication providers, callbacks, and session management settings for NextAuth.
// This file is crucial for setting up the authentication system in a Next.js application, allowing for secure user login and session management.
// It ensures that the authentication flow is handled correctly, providing a robust solution for user management in the application.
