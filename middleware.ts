Extracts the pathname from the request URL.

Returns true if a valid authentication token exists (i.e., the user is logged in).

Why?:
You donâ€™t want to protect or slow down access to static assets or public files.

/*
Behind the Scenes & Project Integration
How it works in your project:
Every request (except static/public assets) passes through this middleware.
The authorized callback checks if the route is public or requires authentication.
If the route is public or the user is authenticated, the request continues.
If not, NextAuth will redirect the user to the login page or return a 401 for API routes.
Why use withAuth?
It automatically handles session/token parsing, redirects, and integrates with your NextAuth configuration.
You only need to specify your access rules in one place.
